HOSTED LINK :- https://chirag-chatapp.netlify.app/


 - Functionality
              
            -> Assume you are a dummy logged in user.
            -> Use a json file to load some dummy data in the project.
            -> Search : conversations should be searchable by contact name.

 - Left sidebar:
  
             -> Show all the conversations created here
             -> Each conversation should have the contact name and some text of the last message 
                in the chat

 - Create conversation button

             -> On clicking this open a pop up and load all the contacts (from the dummy 
                data.json/js file).
             -> On clicking the contact should start a new conversation (if no conversation was 
                previously started). Or open the existing conversation for that contact.

 - Right side view
 
             -> Show the current selected conversation messages
             -> Send a message in the conversation
